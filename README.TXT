3D Compressed Sensing Reconstruction Demo

This software is presented as supplementary material for the publication, 
"High-density 3D single molecular analysis based on compressed sensing" 
, Biophysical Journal (2014). 
This demonstration created a simulation frame with some randomly located 
molecules, then perform compressed sensing reconstruction on the generated
frame. This demonstration requires CVX and DIPimage tool box for matlab,
which could be found at its website below:
http://cvxr.com/cvx/
http://www.diplib.org/

To run the demo, move to the directory and type "run", the reconstructed image 
will be displayed when the reconstruction is finished.
